<h1>Smoking</h1>

<h4>Quit Smoking Hypnosis</h4>

<p>If you're looking at this page you have probably been thinking for a while about quitting smoking with hypnosis.  You may have tried a few different approaches - patches, gum, will power but are still smoking.  So what happened?  Why didn't these other tactics work?</p>

<p>Unless the underlying motivations, ideas and thoughts which lay in the subconscious are addressed and brought in to line with that rational mind, you may well be fighting against yourself. My approach in quitting smoking with hypnotherapy creates a whole-hearted stance within the mind to beat that habit with minimal cravings and withdrawals.</p>

<p>If you want to be a non-smoker then Hypnotherapy may be for you.  All that you need to bring to the session is your motivation and desire to be a non-smoker.</p>


<h1>Alcohol</h1>

<h4>Letting go of Alcohol with Hypnosis and Counselling</h4>
 
 <p>Are you beginning to feel that you are drinking too much and would like to do something about it ...? but not sure what?  Are you concerned you are becoming dependant on alcohol to relax you or lift that mood?</p>
 
 <p>Whatever type of drinker you are, if you feel it is excessive then hypnotherapy and counselling may help to reduce that alcohol consumption or allow you to take back control.</p>
 
 
 <p>Through my years of experience, I have developed a highly effective and effective program which enables you to take back control in your life. Using hypnosis, it may be possible to shift thought patterns and habits to let go of that drinking and enable you to either eliminate or moderate your alcohol consumption.  A new habit, may be established enabling you to have a healthier relationship with alcohol or to let it go completely.  Any physical symptoms around letting go of the alcohol may be managed with substitute or distraction techniques.</p>
 
 
 <p>Are you one of those people who tends to 'drown their sorrows' or push down past experiences with alcohol?
I take time with you to find out why you have felt the need drink and resolve those feelings and thoughts which have fuelled the alcohol consumption.  This approach may create confidence in knowing that the reasons behind the drinking are no longer there.
</p>


<h1>Gambling</h1>

 <p>Gambling, like other addictions, can destroy families and lives.  People can lose their homes, their loved ones and everything they value and feel helpless to do anything about it.  Hypnotherapy can support you to let go of this habit by looking at the causes or reasons this is happening.  All you need to bring is your motivation to let this go.</p>
 
 <p>There are very few positives associated with gambling and tends to create multiple problems.  Where will you be in a few years if you continue on this path?</p>

<!--<h3>The sessions:</h3>

<p>Each session lasts about 90 minutes and is individually tailored to your particular circumstances.  Nobody is alike.  Smokers all have their favourite places and times to smoke and all smoke for different reasons.  Through discussion, the reasons that you smoke and that keep you a smoker are examined and used in the hypnosis session.</p>-->
